                                The melting of ski resorts has become more of a pressing issue in recent times. According to the University of Waterloo, 1/8 ski resorts will disappear in the next century. If we don't push for change, then skiing as a whole can disappear.

                                With several factors such as climate change and high levels of emissions, the melting rate of ski resorts has rapid increased in recent times. The IEA has found that emissions are at their highest this year, meaning skiing in 2025 is at risk in many places.

                                The main cause of melting ski resorts are the emissions that these resorts release. Snowmakers are the most responsible for this, and as the snow melts faster, we'll need more snowmaking. This all leads us down a slippery slope that'll be hard to escape.

                                Climate change is the cause behind all of this, so decreasing our carbon footprint in general will always be a way to help protect the future of ski resorts. Some simple methods are walking or biking instead of driving, as well as investing in resuable items such as water bottles.
